    <div class="col-1">
        <p>My name is Jack Hennigan and I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to check out my design
            portfolio. I am currently in my first year at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) studying a
            Bachelor of Design (Digital Media). I have a strong passion for design work, especially in the fields of
            graphic design and sound design. My personal hobbies include film photography, music making, as well as
            watching bad films from time to time with my roommates.</p>
        <p>This design portfolio will be showcasing the various works I have created as a part of the assessment
            tasks for my Design Media Studio 1: Production class. I hope to showcase not only the works themselves,
            but to also showcase my skills developing through the competition of each assessment task; and how my
            understanding of key techniques and skills I was taught in class has been implemented into each
            completed work. I hope you enjoy! :-)</p>

                <p>For our first assessment we were tasked with creating an entirely new video out of two already made
                    components; one would be a video we could use for visuals, and the other video can have its audio be
                    reassembled to use as audio for our new video. The purpose of this task was to create an entirely
                    new
                    narrative using editing skills that we had learnt in class. This new video was to be assembled using
                    the
                    program Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
                <p>We were given a list of videos to choose from to create our reconstructed video edits from. I
                    initially
                    had chosen an animated documentary video about urban planning in the United Kingdom and made a rough
                    edit from that without any audio. However after receiving feedback from my tutor and classmates
                    about
                    the edit, I decided to choose another video to focus my edit on.</p>
                <p>Using a documentary video from the listed videos given to us titled "In Search of Ancient
                    Astronauts",
                    which focused on the theory of ancient astronauts having visited Earth before, and then using audio
                    from
                    a documentary titled "This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Message‚Äù, I creat an
                    video in which the narrative focused on a group of people building a spaceship that
                    visits the Moon and comes back to Earth. I also used stock music from YouTube Audio Library for the
                    soundtrack of the short video.</p>
                <p>Overall I was happy with the way the video ended up turning out in the end, and the editing skills
                    that I
                    had learned from this experience would not only come in handy for my time at university, but also
                    for my
                    future career skills as well.</p>

            <div class="col-1">
                <p>In this assessment we were tasked with creating nine responsive icon designs, as well as a website to
                    host the designs for users to interact with. The icon designs would all have to relate to an overall
                    theme of our choosing and be created using Adobe Illustrator, with Visual Studio Code being used to
                    build the coding of the website.
                </p>
                <p>I first started off by using a sketching process to come up with various designs relating to a few
                    different themes I had in mind for the assessment. After a while of experimenting with my designs
                    and
                    overall ideas I decided to focus on the theme of dreams; more specifically lucid dreaming. I choose
                    this
                    because of the fun possibilities that could come about due to the often surreal nature of lucid
                    dreaming
                    descriptions.
                </p>
                <p>I began doing research on lucid dreaming and began brainstorming ideas on how to best present this
                    overall theme in an effective manner for viewers to interact with. The most challenging aspect was
                    how
                    broad lucid dreaming as a whole can be for different people given the often abstract nature. However
                    I
                    used this abstract nature to my advantage, and create a overall narrative describing a persons
                    experience during lucid dreaming from this. With the sound design I used a DAW (digital audio
                    workstation) called Ableton Live to create the interactive sounds using synth plug-ins. Once this
                    was
                    all completed I then assembled an edited version of a template we were given in class for the
                    website
                    layout.
                </p>
                <p>To conclude, I believe it was this assessment task in particular I began to notice my overall design
                    aesthetic forming, which would influence the next assessment task heavily.</p>

            <div class="col-1">
                <p>For this assessment we were tasked with creating a 3D digital environment walkthrough experience
                    based on
                    the theme of personal change faced by either someone we know or ourselves. We were also asked to
                    showcase the change we or they had experience through the changing of landscape seen throughout the
                    walkthrough experience. This experience was to be entirely created using the program Unity. We were
                    allowed to use 3D assets that we sourced online to help us to create our own experiences.</p>
                <p>After a lengthy thought and sketching process I decided to focus on my own personal change I've
                    experienced in the year 2022; which was my move from Brisbane down to Melbourne, which also meant
                    changing universities. I had somewhat grand ideas for how to showcase this in my 3D digital
                    environment,
                    but after a lengthy experimentation process using Unity I managed to narrow it down to a simple yet
                    effective experience idea.</p>
                <p>The digital environment implements a low poly cartoon-like aesthetic, which was inspired by various
                    video
                    games that I enjoy such as Katamari Demacy. I wanted to continue to use cartoon inspired aesthetics
                    that
                    I first implemented in my second assessment task, hoping to give a majority of my work in this class
                    an
                    overall sense of unity. Overall I was happy with how the final experience turned out, and through
                    experimenting I managed to narrow down from a somewhat complicated initial idea to a simple and
                    moving
                    experience for users to witness for themselves.</p>
